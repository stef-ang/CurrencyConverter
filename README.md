- It calculates currency conversion from selected currency to all other currencies.
- Every currency conversion calculation will be recorded as history conversion.
  - User can delete the history
- It support offline mode and to limit bandwidth, the app won't refetch remote data within 30 minutes.

## ü¶æ How to use

- Generate your openexchangerates App ID [here](https://openexchangerates.org/account/app-ids).
- Open `gradle.properties` file and put your openexchangerates App ID as value of `OpenExchangeApiKey`.
- OR open `local.properties` file and add `OpenExchangeApiKey="[your_app_id]"`

## üìê Architecture and Design Principles

This app adopts [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) with [Unidirectional flow (UDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) pattern. It follows [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to achieve maintainable, scalable and testable code base. Also the code base has been structured in multi-module project.
Thanks to [this architecture-template repository](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) because initiation of this project used that template.
